# 🧹📊 EDA, Cleaning & Wrangling  

Welcome to this repository! This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, and Data Wrangling** to prepare datasets for further analysis and modeling. The goal is to **clean, transform, and explore data** to uncover insights and ensure high-quality datasets.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- **`datasets/`** – Raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis  
- **`notebooks/`** – Jupyter notebooks for EDA, data cleaning, and transformation  
- **`scripts/`** – Python scripts for automation and preprocessing  
- **`reports/`** – Summary reports, findings, and visualizations  

## 🔍 Key Focus Areas  

✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (summary statistics, visualizations)  
✅ **Handling Missing Values** (imputation, removal)  
✅ **Outlier Detection & Treatment**  
✅ **Data Transformation & Encoding**  
✅ **Feature Engineering & Selection**  
✅ **Merging, Aggregating, & Reshaping Data**  
✅ **String Cleaning & Date Formatting**  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)  
- **SQL** (for data extraction and cleaning)
